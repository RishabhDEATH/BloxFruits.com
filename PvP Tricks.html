<p style="font-size:20px; font-type:Calisto MT;">In a typical game like blox fruits pvp matters . <br>The best time to start pvp is when you reach level 2300 because you will get all essential materials like Cursed Dual Katana and Soul Guitar.<br>These Items will help you in stuns and most of people use them for Pvp.<br>The best fruits for you will be dough,Buddha, Love if your aims are good.<br>I consider them best for you because they are no skill.<br>If you think to use dough then ask us for help because there will be people who will ask for fruits and scam you.<br>When u get all of the suggested materials then you need to learn combos for dough and love here are some easy combos for you.<br>

<h4 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;">When you reach Maximum level</h4>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-type:Calisto MT;">I would suggest to keep dough if you get comfortable with it and leave buddha and love(it is an exeption if you get 3m bounty or above then keep it )But leave buddha.<br>
I would suggest fruits like dough till 5m then ice till  7.5 m then spirit till 10m .<br>You should use dough or ice after it because of good stuns potential and experties.<br>Ice is great option because the combo of awaken ice can even kill a person with 30m bounty.<br>If you want to be admin killer then I would suggest you the godly build of Portal fruit in seccond sea with Hollow Scythe.<br>This is the only build that can help you to kill admins.<br>This build was able to kill admin Uzoth and Almost kill admin Zioles"aka"Fruit Gaccha.<br>
